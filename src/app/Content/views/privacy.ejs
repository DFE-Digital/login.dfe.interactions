        <p class="govuk-body">
            This privacy notice explains how we collect and use your personal information for DfE Sign-in service.
            DfE Sign-in is run by the Department for Education (DfE).
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            For the purposes of relevant data protection legislation, the Department for Education (DfE) is the 
            data controller for personal information processed for this research.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we use your personal information</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            DfE collects your personal information when you use DfE Sign-in. We use the data to allow you access 
            to DfE online services
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">We collect and use the following personal information only where we need to and law permits:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Your first name and last name</li>
            <li>The email address you provide</li>
            <li>The organisation details the account is linked to</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we hold personal information</h2>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">
            We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we
            collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting 
            requirements. DfE Sign-in will only keep personal data for up to 6 years from the date on which 
            an individual deactivates / deletes their account.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who we share your personal information with</h2>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">We may share your information where the law allows, or where we have a legal obligation to do so. </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What is the legal basis for collecting and processing the data</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            In order for the use of personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions 
            in the data protection legislation, as set out in Article 6(1) of the General Data Protection 
            Regulation (GDPR). For the purpose of DfE Sign-in, the relevant condition that we are meeting 
            is ‘public task’ as specified under Article 6 (1)(e) of the GDPR. The legislation to support 
            this is Section 8 of the Data Protection Act 2018 – exercising official authority as part of 
            public body tasks and Department for Education functions.
